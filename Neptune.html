<li> Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun. 
<li> In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
<li> Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.
<li> Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane.. </font>

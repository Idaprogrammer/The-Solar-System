<li> Saturn is sometimes called "The Jewel of the Solar System."
<li> Its beautiful rings are not solid. They are made up of bits of ice, dust and rock.
<li> The rings are huge but thin. The main rings could almost go from Earth to the moon. Yet, they are less than a kilometer thick.
<li> Other planets have rings. Saturn's rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth. All you need is a small telescope. </font>

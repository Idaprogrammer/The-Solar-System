<li>Venus is the second planet from the Sun
<li>It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
<li>It is the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight
<li>Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn
<li> Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days
<li> Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.

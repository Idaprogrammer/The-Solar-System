<li> Earth is the third planet from the Sun
<li> It is the only planet that can support life
<li> It is spherical in shape
<li> Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.
